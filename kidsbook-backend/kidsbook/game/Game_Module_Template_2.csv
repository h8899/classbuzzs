character,Curt,"Hi guys, so we were supposed to discuss this.. Let’s get this moving",,
character,Paulina,"If only we got to choose our own groups, now we’re stuck with Kenzo the dumb-a**",,
character,Curt,Yeah we can get the dumb one to present the project for us,,
character,Paulina,"Ha, ok but before that we gotta get some content out",,
choice,<player>,Shall we ask Kenzo if he’s comfortable to present first?,Upstanding,2
choice,<player>,Can we get down to the task and decide on presenting later?,Ignoring,2
choice,<player>,"Yeah fa**** Kenzo, where are you... You hear that you gotta present yeah?",Hurtful Comment,2
,,,,
Scene ,2,,,
character,Kenzo,Ok I will present,,
character,Paulina,"DUH, you don’t have a choice",,
character,Kenzo,Ok let’s start. We are supposed to discuss our stand on whether shoppers should pay for plastic bags when they go to supermarkets,,
character,Paulina,"Ha, yes smarty pants, so what do YOU think?",,
character,Curt,"Haha, come on give him a break, before he starts wailing to his mother",,
choice,<player>,"Ok get back to the question guys. I think I’m cool with charging people for plastic bags, let’s save the earth man, what do you guys think?",Ignoring,3
choice,<player>,Only Kenzo should pay for plastic bags,Hurtful Comment,4
choice,<player>,"Ok guys... It won’t hurt for all of us to be kinder with our words, shall we not get personal with Kenzo?",Upstanding,5
,,,,
Scene ,3,,,
character,Curt,"Yeah, a lot of countries enforce this payment rule and I think it works to get people to bring their own bags",,
character,Kenzo,Yeah I agree,,
character,Paulina,"Come on, tell us something new Kenzo ha, stop ***ing around",,
character,Curt,"Haha leave him alone, come on, he’s gonna start complaining to our teacher soon",,
character,Paulina,"Yeah, what a wimp",,
character,Curt,"SO, in my humble opinion, I am supportive of the payment rule for plastic bags, I think if such things are not enforced, people will not see a need to change the way they are living.",,
character,Kenzo,"Yup, I agree and we can hope that it becomes a habit that grows on everyone…",,
character,Paulina,"Duh, I don’t need you to tell me you agree with everything kenzoboy. Tell me something I don’t know.",,
choice,<player>,"Kenzo is just gonna agree with everything we say, forget it Paulina!",Hurtful Comment,6
choice,<player>,"Paulina, if you’re not gonna stop with the name-calling, I will let Ms Tan know that you aren’t helping the discussion at all.",Upstanding,7
choice,<player>,"Well, I think enforcing payment has its pros and cons – I’m not sure how well the supermarket enterprises will take this?",Ignoring,8
,,,,
Scene ,4,,,
character,Curt,"HA, maybe he can’t even afford one",,
character,Paulina,Whut. That’s just lame.,,
character,Kenzo,Please…. Can we get back to our discussion?,,
character,Paulina,Oh look who’s coming out of his hole now…….,,
character,Curt,"Kenzo the wimp! Ha. Anyway I guess… I am supportive of the payment rule for plastic bags, I think if such things are not enforced, people will not see a need to change the way they are living.",,
character,Kenzo,"Yup, I agree and we can hope that it becomes a habit that grows on everyone…",,
character,Paulina,"Duh, I don’t need you to tell me you agree with everything kenzoboy. Tell me something I don’t know.",,
choice,<player>,Ok we don’t have much time left. Let’s get back to discussing the question first.,Ignoring,9
choice,<player>,"Ok guys, let’s not go overboard with our words to Kenzo…",Upstanding,10
choice,<player>,"Yeah, that’s Kenzo trying to be heard…",Hurtful Comment,11
,,,,
Scene,5,,,
character,Curt,"Allllllright, will try. Come on, so what’s our take on plastic bags? We gotta have a group stand.",,
character,Paulina,"I don’t know... I guess my take is that, there’s no harm in making people pay so this will discourage them from using plastic bags unnecessarily",,
character,Kenzo,"Yup, so only those who really need the bag will pay for it... I think that will help to save the environment in the near future",,
character,Paulina,Yes smartie pants ,,
character,Curt,It may help to keep the cost of the plastic bags to 10 cents maybe? What does smartie pants think?,,
choice,<player>,"Ok guys, shush. Kenzo is just helping by sharing with us his opinions.",Upstanding,12
choice,<player>,"Ok let’s move on, so we are good with this stand?",Ignoring,13
choice,<player>,SMARTIE PANTS INDEED. Tell us more.,Hurtful Comment,14
,,,,
Scene ,6,,,
character,Paulina,Ha that is true.,,
character,Curt,Okay time check! We have about 5 more minutes left to discuss this. KENZO do you know what you’re supposed to present yet?!,,
character,Kenzo,"Not really, I don’t think we have got much content out yet as a team.",,
character,Paulina,"Oh gosh. Please don’t make us fail the assignment. So, Kenzo smartie pants, summarise what we’ve talked about so far and we will see what’s missing.",,
character,Kenzo,"Urgh stop calling me smartie pants, will you.",,
character,Paulina,"OH LOOK, THE WIMP IS SPEAKING UP……",,
character,Curt,"Hahahaha what do you think Kenzo? Before you start crying, give us an answer first.",,
character,Kenzo,So most of us agree that we should allow payment for plastic bags in supermarkets to help to save the environment.,,
character,Paulina,"Justify it dude, is that all?!",,
choice,<player>,Yeah you need to JUSTIFY the statement Kenzo. It’s not your first time doing a presentation. Time is running out.,Hurtful Comment,END
choice,<player>,"Ok Paulina, chill. Be mindful of how you’re talking here!",Upstanding,END
choice,<player>,Ok I remember we mentioned that it may require some ‘enforced rule’ before people would follow. You can include this reason as a justification Kenzo.,Ignoring,END
,,,,
Scene ,7,,,
character,Paulina,"Ok fine I will stop. I was just kidding, come on",,
character,Curt,So we’ve got an argument up for the question yeah? I think we should present two sides to it and decide as a team what our stand is and why we decided it as such.,,
character,Kenzo,"Yeah, Curt spoke about the reasons to support paying for plastics because when enforced, people will follow and hopefully this slowly changes their way of living, at least where plastic bags are concerned ",,
character,Paulina,"You finally got something out, Kenzo. So what about the opposite side, kid? Why do we not support paying for plastic bags??",,
choice,<player>,"What do you suggest, Paulina? We could communicate better if you could keep your tone in check as well.",Upstanding,END
choice,<player>,"Yeah Kenzo, what’s your take? Since you managed to summarise what Curt said so well, huh.",Hurtful Comment,END
choice,<player>,Ok my take is that perhaps we shouldn’t enforce it because people these days don’t take to enforcements very well. We could start by educating people more on the negative impact of using plastic bags and get them to understand the impact? ,Ignoring,END
,,,,
Scene ,8,,,
character,Kenzo,"Yeah, even if they don’t take it well, if it’s a law, they just got to follow it…",,
character,Curt,Hah I didn’t need you to tell me that Kenzo. SO time check! We have about 5 more minutes left to discuss this. KENZO do you know what you’re supposed to present yet?!,,
character,Kenzo,"Not really, I don’t think we have got much content out yet as a team.",,
