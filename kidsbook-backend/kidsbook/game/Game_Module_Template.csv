character,Curt,"Haha leave him alone, come on, he’s gonna start complaining to our teacher soon",,
character,Paulina,"Yeah, what a wimp",,

character,Kenzo,"Yup, I agree and we can hope that it becomes a habit that grows on everyone…",,
character,Paulina,"Duh, I don’t need you to tell me you agree with everything kenzoboy. Tell me something I don’t know.",,

,,,,
Scene,5,,,
character,Curt,"Allllllright, I will try. Come on, so what’s our take on plastic bags? We gotta have a stand.",,
character,Paulina,"I don’t know.. I guess my take is that, there’s no harm in making people pay so this will discourage them from using plastic bags unnecessarily",,
character,Kenzo,"Yup, so only those who really need the bag will pay for it.. I think that will help to save the environment in the near future ",,
character,Paulina,Yes smartie pants ,,
character,Curt,It may help to keep the cost of the plastic bags to 10 cents maybe? What does smarty pants think? ,,
choice,<player>,"Ok guys, shush. Kenzo is just helping by sharing with us his opinions. ",Upstanding,END
choice,<player>,"Ok moving on, so we are good with this stand? ",Ignoring,END
